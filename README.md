# BREAST-CANCER-HISTOLOGY-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-DEEP-NEURAL-NETWORK
The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can classify histology images into different classes, based on the phase of cancer they are in. four classes are used: Benign, Insitu, Invasive, Normal. however, the main challenge is not only to classify the images but also to perform the classification in with higher accuracy and precision.  There is an extensive work in the field of healthcare and also cancer phase detection in particular, and a number of reviews exists.  One of the most important aspects of Machine Learning in health care is the accuracy I obtain. My aim is to classify histology images into different classes with acceptable accuracy and precision.
